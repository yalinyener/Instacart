# Project-03:  Predicting Customer Behaviour and Market Basket Analysis

This repo contains Project-03 data and solution at Istanbul Data Science Academy. Project-03 is about Classification of Instacart Dataset.

## Classification:

Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new observations or classifications.

Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories.

The classification predictive modelling is the task of approximating the mapping function from input variables to discrete output variables. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into. (Edureka)

## Objective and Goal:

Finding customer behaviour by using market basket analysis techniques and try to predict next order
